## Launch your first GPU Virtual Machine
- From the platform, head over to [GPU Instances](https://platform.qubrid.com/create-ai-compute/gpu-instances) 
- **Select** your preferred **GPU** Instance (Example: [A100](https://platform.qubrid.com/create-ai-compute/NVIDIA%20A100%20(40GB)))
- Choose the **number of GPUs** you'd need, it might be 1,4 or 8
- vCPU Core & RAM is populated based on the GPU Instance which is selected
- Choose your **Root Disk storage** in Gigabytes (Starts at 100 GB & goes till 2 TB)
- Select your **Interface** Console. By default its set to Jupyter, but if you want to access your machine via SSH, enable the SSH Option & provide your Public Key
- Enter your Jupyter Authentication Token only, in case you don't want to access via SSH
- Configure **Auto Stop**, to shuts down the instance after a specific amount of time
- **Review** your selections from the floating wizard at the right part of the dashboard
- Once you have reviewed, click on **Launch** to launch your GPU Instance or click on **Reset** to start over again

<Note>
  **Root Disk Storage** is billed at **10 Cents per GB/month** & is charged even when the instance is stopped. So, 100 GB costs $10/month.
</Note>


## Check Usage & Credits
- View your available **credits** in navigation bar provided  
- Track **usage history** and billing information  
- Add credits (Available for **\$5**, **\$10**, **\$30**, **\$50** or some **custom** amount)  

## Do whatever you want!
- Run **inference** using a template or your own model  
- Perform **fine-tuning** on supported models  
- Save and reuse deployed models  
- Use our 2 Step **RAG** or define a custom RAG Pipeline
- Deploy **clusters** of GPUs in 1 Click
- Reserve a **Bare Metal** Server
