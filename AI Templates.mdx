<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - A Valid Qubrid AI Account logged in the platform
  - Enough Credits in your Account should be present to make sure the GPU Instances work when provisioning
</Info>

The **AI/ML Templates** catalog provides preconfigured environments that can be quickly deployed on high-performance **GPU virtual machines**.  

These templates include popular frameworks, open-source large language models (LLMs), orchestration tools, and workflow engines, saving you the effort of manual setup.  


## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Head over to the AI / ML tab from the left menu">
 This will list all the templates available for quick use
</Step>
<Step title="Select a template from the catalog">
  Choose an AI/ML template from the catalog that matches your use case. Templates include OS images, frameworks, workflow tools, and preconfigured LLMs.
</Step>
<Step title="Select a GPU Instance">
  Once you do this, a dropdown appears, choose the GPU instance where you want to deploy with this AI/ML template
</Step>
<Step title="Review the Instance">
  Here you will be able to see the RAM, vCPU, System Storage, OS, Python Version, CUDA Version & Max GPUs allocated
</Step>
<Step title="Customise the Instance">
  Here you will be able to change anything which you wound want. Select commitment period and click Launch Button
</Step>
</Steps>
