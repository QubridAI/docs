## How to Reserve a Bare Metal Server?

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to the Baremetal Page from the left menu">
 You will be able to check all the available Bare Metal server configurations along with pricing & details such as CPU, Memory, Boot Stoage, Main Storage & Network
</Step>
<Step title="Select your preferred Baremetal Server">
 This will open a dialog box which shows you a form that needs to be filled in to send in a request for the server
</Step>
<Step title="Select your Commitment Period">
 Normally Bare Metal Servers are available for a tenure starting at 1 Year. If you want a custom tenure, you can mention that in the Notes part
</Step>
<Step title="Enter the details required">
 This is the place to enter your email (same as the email which was used for logging in), name & phone number
</Step>
<Step title="Enter the Organization name">
 This step will help you unlock Organizational disounts. This is optional
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If you want the server for a custom timeframe, or anything that will help us give you the best price, **Notes** is where you put those thoughts

## Key Benefits

#### Full Hardware Access
- No virtualization layer: direct access to CPU, GPU, and memory resources.  
- Better performance and lower latency compared to VMs.  

#### Dedicated Resources
- 100% of the server’s GPUs, CPUs, RAM, and disks are reserved for your workloads.  
- Eliminates “noisy neighbor” problems from shared cloud environments.  

#### Enterprise-Grade Performance
- Optimized for **training large language models (LLMs)**, high-throughput inference, and large-scale distributed training.  
- Supports **multi-GPU and NVLink/NVSwitch interconnects** for advanced workloads.  

#### Security & Compliance
- Single-tenant isolation ensures **data privacy** and compliance for enterprise, healthcare, and finance workloads.  
- Option for **on-premises or hybrid deployment**.  

#### Flexibility & Control
- Choose from multiple configurations (GPU types, memory, storage).  
- Install custom drivers, frameworks, or OS images as needed.  

## When to Choose Baremetal

Baremetal servers are recommended when you need:
- **Large-Scale Training**: Multi-billion parameter models requiring multiple GPUs.  
- **High-Performance Inference**: Large-scale production serving with minimal latency.  
- **Long-Running Jobs**: Persistent workloads that run for days/weeks without interruption.  
- **Custom Environments**: Full control over OS, drivers, and frameworks.  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Environments where data must remain fully isolated.  

For smaller, short-lived, or cost-sensitive workloads, consider GPU Instances instead.

## Billing

- **Hourly or Monthly Plans** available depending on your use case.  
- **Storage billed separately** (root disk + attached volumes).  
- **Pause/Stop not available**: Baremetal servers are always billed while provisioned.  

<Note>
Use baremetal for **long-running or mission-critical jobs**. Keep **root disk minimal** and store large datasets in external storage. Use **job schedulers** (Slurm, Kubernetes) for multi-GPU workloads. Enable **monitoring** via `nvidia-smi` or platform dashboards. Regularly **rotate SSH/API credentials** for security.
