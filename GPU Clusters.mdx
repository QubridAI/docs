description: 'GPU Clusters let you scale beyond a single node'

Your GPUs can now communicate seamlessly across machines, eliminating the old per-node limits and unlocking true multi-node clusters. Spin up as many GPUs as you need, pay only by the second, and stop anytime - no commitments, just on-demand scalability like regular GPU VMs.

## How to request for a cluster?

<Steps>
<Step title="Select your GPU Model">
 Select from a pool of B200, H200, H100, A100, L40S, to start with the clusters
</Step>
<Step title="Select the type of Clusters">
 When creating a GPU Cluster, you can choose between **Slurm Cluster** or **Kubernetes Cluster**, depending on your workload and orchestration needs.
</Step>
<Step title="Enter the quantity of Nodes">
 Each node consists of 8 GPUs. For example, requesting 8 nodes will give you access to 64 GPUs.
</Step>
<Step title="Select the location for your Data Center">
 We have Data Centers in North America, Europe & Asia. These are SOC Type II & HIPAA complaint.
</Step>
<Step title="Select the Start Date">
 This will help us understand how soon do you want to start. 
</Step>
<Step title="Provide Personal & Cluster Details">
 Enter your Organization name & the duration for which you would like the Clusters for (In Month)
</Step>
<Step title="Enter the remaining details">

### Type of Cluster

When creating a GPU Cluster, you can choose between **Slurm Cluster** or **Kubernetes Cluster**, depending on your workload and orchestration needs.

#### Slurm Cluster
- **Best for**: HPC (High-Performance Computing), AI/ML training, research workloads.  
- **Why**: Slurm is an industry-standard open-source job scheduler widely used in supercomputing.  
- **Features**:  
  - Efficient scheduling for batch jobs and distributed training.  
  - Optimized for large-scale GPU utilization.  
  - Simple job submission (`sbatch`, `srun`).  

#### Kubernetes Cluster
- **Best for**: Enterprise AI services, production deployments, containerized workloads.  
- **Why**: Kubernetes is the standard for container orchestration and microservices.  
- **Features**:  
  - Run distributed AI inference services at scale.  
  - Manage workloads with pods, deployments, and autoscaling.  
  - Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines and cloud-native tools.  

<Note>
Choose **Slurm Cluster**: If you are doing **training, HPC jobs, or large-scale distributed ML experiments**. Choose **Kubernetes Cluster**: If you are running **production inference, containerized services, or multi-team workloads**.  
</Note>

## Key Features
- **Multi-Node Scaling**: Run workloads that span multiple nodes, each with 8 GPUs.  
- **No Commitments**: Spin up a cluster whenever you need it and stop anytime.  
- **Flexible GPU Options**: Choose from B200, H200, H100, A100, and L40S GPUs.  
- **Pay-As-You-Go**: Billed per second, just like individual GPU instances.  
- **Cluster Management**: Launch using a scheduler such as **Slurm** for distributed job orchestration.  


## Example: Cluster Setup

- **GPU Model**: B200 (180 GB VRAM)  
- **Cluster Type**: Slurm  
- **Node Quantity**: 2 (16 GPUs total)  
- **Data Center**: North America  
- **Start Date**: 27-09-2025  
- **Total VRAM**: 2256 GB  

## Use Cases
- **Large-Scale LLM Training**: Train multi-billion parameter models across 100+ GPUs.  
- **Scientific & HPC Workloads**: Molecular dynamics, physics simulations, and genomics.  
- **Enterprise AI**: Multi-tenant, distributed inference services.  
- **Research Collaboration**: Share clusters among teams for parallel experimentation.  

## Billing
- **Per-Second Billing**: Pay only for the runtime of your cluster.  
- **No Idle Compute Costs**: Stop clusters when not in use.  
- **Storage Billing**: Root disk and attached volumes are billed separately.  

<Info>
 Use **Auto Stop** to avoid idle compute charges. Store large datasets in **external object storage** to reduce root disk usage. Use **Slurm job scheduling** to efficiently distribute workloads across nodes. Start small (1–2 nodes) and scale up as needed.
