The API Key Generation feature allows you to securely access and interact with open-source models and deployed Hugging Face models on the Qubrid AI Platform. This key enables seamless integration into external apps, tools, or workflows via API requests - empowering you to run model queries programmatically.
<Note>
  You should be logged in the Qubrid AI Platform in order to generate an API Key

## What Are API Keys?

**API Keys** are unique identifiers that allow you to authenticate and securely access the Qubrid Platform APIs.  
They are required when you want to interact with the platform programmatically — for example, to launch GPU instances, deploy models, or run inference from your own applications.

#### Key Points
- **Authentication**: Every API request must include a valid API key to verify your identity.  
- **User-Specific**: Keys are tied to your account or organization. You can generate multiple keys if needed.  
- **Permissions**: API keys inherit your account permissions (e.g., project access, team role).  
- **Security**: Keep your API keys private. Never share them publicly or commit them to version control.  

#### Typical Use Cases
- Automating GPU instance creation.  
- Deploying or managing AI templates and workflows via scripts.  
- Running inference jobs directly from your application.  
- Integrating Qubrid into CI/CD pipelines.
