The API Key Generation feature allows you to securely access and interact with open-source models and deployed Hugging Face models on the Qubrid AI Platform. This key enables seamless integration into external apps, tools, or workflows via API requests - empowering you to run model queries programmatically.
<Note>
  You should be logged in the Qubrid AI Platform in order to generate an API Key

## How to generate an API Key?

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to User Card located in the bottom left">
  The User Card looks like, your profile initials on the left followed by Name & Email stacked on top of each other on the right
</Step>
<Step title="Click on the User Card">
  Clicking there shows you your Email ID, Billing Tab & **Get API Key** options
</Step>
<Step title="Click on the Get API Key button">
  You will now be able to see a dialog box, containing a field which will show the API Key once you generate it
</Step>
<Step title="Click on the Regenerate API Key button">
  The field will show something like ********, clicking on the button will change status to fetching & generate the API Key
</Step>
<Step title="Click on the Copy button">
  Clicking here you can copy the API Key and use this in your model by passinng it with the ```API_KEY``` parameter
</Step>
<Step title="Click on the Close button">
  Once you have your API Key, keep it safe with you & dont share it with others.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Important: Please copy and securely store your API key. It will only be displayed once upon generation. If you lose this key, you will need to regenerate a new one.

## What Are API Keys?

**API Keys** are unique identifiers that allow you to authenticate and securely access the Qubrid Platform APIs.  
They are required when you want to interact with the platform programmatically â€” for example, to launch GPU instances, deploy models, or run inference from your own applications.

#### Key Points
- **Authentication**: Every API request must include a valid API key to verify your identity.  
- **User-Specific**: Keys are tied to your account or organization. You can generate multiple keys if needed.  
- **Permissions**: API keys inherit your account permissions (e.g., project access, team role).  
- **Security**: Keep your API keys private. Never share them publicly or commit them to version control.  

#### Typical Use Cases
- Automating GPU instance creation.  
- Deploying or managing AI templates and workflows via scripts.  
- Running inference jobs directly from your application.  
- Integrating Qubrid into CI/CD pipelines.
