## Model Overview

**Z Image Turbo** is a distilled variant of the Z-Image family designed for fast and efficient image generation.  
- It is built on a 6B-parameter foundation model and optimized to achieve strong image quality with low inference cost.  
- Z Image Turbo supports photorealistic image generation, bilingual text rendering (English and Chinese), and robust instruction adherence.  
- The model is optimized for low latency inference with a fixed single-image output and supports a wide range of image resolutions.  
- It also provides optional prompt enhancement with reasoning support through the `prompt_extend` parameter.
