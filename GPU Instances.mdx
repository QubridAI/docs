## Choosing the Right GPU

Different workloads require different levels of performance, memory, and cost efficiency. Below is guidance on when to choose each GPU type:

#### NVIDIA B200 (180 GB)
- **Best for:** Next-gen large-scale AI model training and high-throughput inference.  
- **Why:** Highest VRAM capacity with extreme bandwidth, optimized for cutting-edge foundation models and multi-trillion parameter research.  

#### NVIDIA H200 (141 GB)
- **Best for:** Large LLMs, enterprise-scale training, and memory-intensive inference.  
- **Why:** Higher memory than H100 with strong bandwidth, designed for advanced generative AI workloads.  

#### NVIDIA H100 (80 GB)
- **Best for:** High-performance model training, fine-tuning, and distributed workloads.  
- **Why:** Current industry standard for large model training; excellent tensor performance.  

#### NVIDIA A100 (80 GB / 40 GB)
- **Best for:** Training and inference at scale; versatile for research and production.  
- **Why:** Proven workhorse for AI/ML; available in 40 GB and 80 GB VRAM options depending on dataset/model size.  

#### NVIDIA L40S (48 GB)
- **Best for:** Balanced training, inference, and AI-enhanced graphics workloads.  
- **Why:** Strong GPU compute with large memory; good middle ground for enterprises running mixed AI + visualization tasks.  

#### NVIDIA A10G (24 GB)
- **Best for:** Medium-scale training, fine-tuning, and inference for open-source models.  
- **Why:** Cost-efficient GPU for developers and teams experimenting with models up to mid-range size.  

#### NVIDIA T4 (16 GB)
- **Best for:** Lightweight inference, prototyping, and smaller-scale AI services.  
- **Why:** Low-cost, energy-efficient option; good for deploying chatbots, RAG pipelines, or small LLMs.  

#### NVIDIA L4 (24 GB)
- **Best for:** Cloud inference, AI-powered video, and general-purpose ML tasks.  
- **Why:** Modern upgrade over T4 with more memory and stronger inference throughput.  


<Note>
**For research & cutting-edge models:** B200, H200, H100. **For enterprise training/inference balance:** A100, L40S. **For developers & startups (cost-efficient):** A10G, L4, T4
</Note>

## Root Disk (GB)

The **Root Disk** is the primary storage attached to your GPU instance. It holds the operating system, dependencies, and any data you store locally.

#### Key Points
- **Default Size**: Each instance comes with a default root disk (e.g., 100 GB).  
- **Customizable**: You can increase disk size at deployment time to accommodate datasets, models, or logs.  
- **Persistent Billing**: Root disk storage is billed at **$0.10 per GB per month** and is charged even if the instance is stopped.  
- **Example**: A 100 GB disk costs **$10 per month**.  

#### When to Increase Root Disk
- Training large models that require big datasets stored locally.  
- Running workflows that generate heavy intermediate files or logs.  
- Deploying multiple frameworks or custom libraries on the same instance.  

#### When to Keep It Minimal
- Using external object storage or mounted volumes for datasets.  
- Running lightweight inference or stateless applications.  
- Optimizing costs when persistent local storage is not required.  

## Pausing GPU Instances

You can **pause/stop GPU instances** when they are not in use to reduce costs.

#### Key Points
- **No Compute Charges**: When an instance is paused, you are **not charged for GPU compute**.  
- **Storage Charges Continue**: While paused, you will **still be charged for the root disk and any attached storage**.  
- **Example**:  
  - If you pause a GPU instance with a 100 GB root disk, compute costs stop immediately.  
  - Storage charges continue at **$10/month** until you delete the disk.  

<Note>
**Pause instances** when not running jobs to save on compute costs. **Delete unused disks** or move data to external object storage if long-term retention is not required.
</Note>

## Auto Stop

The **Auto Stop** feature allows you to automatically shut down GPU instances after a specified period of inactivity or based on a timer defined by the user.

#### Key Points
- **Automatic Shutdown**: Instances will automatically stop after the configured time limit.  
- **User Defined**: You can set the time (e.g., 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours) based on your workflow.  
- **Save Costs**: Prevents GPU instances from running idle and accumulating unnecessary compute charges.  
- **Storage Charges Remain**: When an instance is auto-stopped, compute charges stop, but root disk and attached storage charges continue.  

#### Example
- You launch a GPU instance with a 6-hour Auto Stop setting.  
- After 6 hours, the instance automatically shuts down if still running.  
- Compute charges end immediately, but storage continues to be billed.  

<Note>
Always enable Auto Stop for experiments, prototyping, or jobs with predictable runtimes. Use manual control (Pause/Resume) for production workloads that need to stay online.
</Note>

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<Accordion icon="question" title="Can I monitor GPU usage during the session?">
Yes. You can monitor GPU performance using:
- **nvidia-smi** (command-line tool) to view GPU utilization, memory usage, and active processes.  
- **Built-in dashboards** available in the platform for real-time metrics.  
- **Terminal commands** (e.g., `htop`, `watch nvidia-smi`) to track system resource usage.  

Monitoring helps you optimize workloads, identify bottlenecks, and manage GPU allocation efficiently.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="question" title="Is internet access available inside the container?">
Yes. Internet access is **enabled by default** inside all GPU containers. You can:
- Install additional packages via `pip`, `apt`, or `conda`.  
- Download datasets, models, or pre-trained weights from external sources.  
- Use APIs or connect to third-party services.  

<Info>
In some cases (e.g., enterprise deployments, security restrictions), internet access may be **explicitly disabled**. Always verify your project’s configuration.
