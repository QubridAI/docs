description: "Welcome to Qubrid Platform, the complete NeoCloud for AI."
---
Qubrid provides a unified environment where developers, researchers, and enterprises can build, deploy, manage, and scale AI/ML workloads with ease.

Unlike traditional cloud platforms, which are often generic and complex, Qubrid is purpose-built for AI - offering GPU-powered compute, AI-specific templates, managed agents, RAG workflows, and enterprise-ready features like usage tracking, team collaboration, and on-premise deployment options.

This documentation will help you understand the platform, its core features, and how to effectively use it to accelerate your AI journey.

## Why Qubrid?

AI workloads are resource-intensive, fragmented, and expensive to manage on generic cloud platforms. Qubrid solves these challenges by offering:  

1. **AI-First Design**  
   Everything in Qubrid is built for AI/ML - from GPU scheduling to optimized inferencing pipelines.  

2. **Speed to Market**  
   With pre-configured templates, RAG workflows, and one-click agents, you can go from idea to deployment in hours, not weeks.  

3. **Scalability**  
   Run workloads of any size - from small experiments to large distributed GPU clusters - without manual configuration.  

4. **Cost Efficiency**  
   Pay only for what you use, with transparent credits and usage dashboards.  

5. **Collaboration**  
   Manage organizations, teams, roles, and shared credits, so multiple users can work seamlessly.  

6. **Flexibility**  
   Deploy in the Qubrid NeoCloud or bring it on-prem for enterprises needing private/hybrid setups.  

## Who is Qubrid For?

- **Developers**  
  Quickly prototype, test, and deploy AI/ML models without worrying about GPU setup.  

- **Researchers**  
  Run experiments at scale, fine-tune open-source models, and validate results with optimized pipelines.  

- **Startups**  
  Bring AI-powered products to market faster with prebuilt workflows and cost-efficient compute.  

- **Enterprises**  
  Enable teams to collaborate, manage resources, and deploy production AI securely at scale.
