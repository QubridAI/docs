## SSH into your Virtual Machine

To securely access your Virtual Machine on Qubrid AI platform & get full control, you'll need to generate an SSH key pair & share your public key with us. Follow the instructions based on your operating system:

### Windows (Using PowerShell or Git Bash)

<Steps>
<Step title="Open PowerShell or Git Bash">
  You can use either PowerShell (default Windows terminal) or Git Bash (if installed via [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win))
</Step>
<Step title="Generate SSH Key">
  You can use either PowerShell (default Windows terminal) or Git Bash (if installed via [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win))
  ```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
Expected Output  
```bash
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/YourName/.ssh/id_rsa)
```
</Step>
<Step title="Press Enter">
  Do this to accept the default path, or set a custom path in case you want to
</Step>
<Step title="If asked to Enter passphrase">
  You may be asked to enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase) & to enter the same passphrase again
  <Note>
  Press the Enter key twice to skip this step
  </Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Locate Public Key">
  - With **Git Bash**
  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```
  - With **PowerShell**
  ```bash
  type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
  ```
</Step>
<Step title="Copy & Share">
  Copy the entire output of the ```.pub``` file & share it with the platform team.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Use ```PuTTYgen``` (If you use ```PuTTY```) to generate a key (```ed25519``` or ```RSA```). Save the private key (```.ppk```) for ```PuTTY```. Copy the public key text from ```PuTTYgen``` to the ```server``` / ```GitHub```. Use ```Pageant``` (PuTTY agent) to load the ```.ppk``` so ```PuTTY``` can use it.
</Info>

### Ubuntu or Linux (Debian-based, Fedora, Arch, etc.)

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Terminal">
  Keyboard shortcut: ```Ctrl``` + ```Alt``` + ```T```
</Step>
<Step title="Generate SSH Key">
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```
  Expected Output  
```bash
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa)
```
</Step>
<Step title="Press Enter">
  Do this to accept the default path, or set a custom path in case you want to
</Step>
<Step title="If asked to Enter passphrase">
  You may be asked to enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase) & to enter the same passphrase again
  <Note>
  Press the Enter key twice to skip this step
  </Note>
</Step>
<Step title="View the Public Key">
  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```
</Step>
<Step title="Copy & Share">
  Copy the entire output & share it with the platform team.
</Step>
</Steps>

### MacOS


<Steps>
<Step title="Open Terminal">
  Use Spotlight (```Cmd``` + ```Space```), type ```Terminal```, and select it. Alternatively, you can also use ```cmd``` + ```N```
</Step>
<Step title="Generate SSH Key">
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```
    Expected Output  
```bash
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa)
```
</Step>
<Step title="Press Enter">
  Do this to accept the default path, or set a custom path in case you want to
</Step>
<Step title="If asked to Enter passphrase">
  You may be asked to enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase) & to enter the same passphrase again
  <Note>
  Press the Enter key twice to skip this step
  </Note>
</Step>
<Step title="View the Public Key">
  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```
</Step>
<Step title="Copy & Share">
  Copy the entire content of the ```.pub``` file & share it with the platform team.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Do not share your **private key** (```id_rsa```). Only the **public key** (```id_rsa.pub```) is safe to share. If the ```.ssh directory``` does not exist, it will be created during the process.
</Note>

<Info>
You may repeat this process to overwrite or specify a custom file name for a **new key pair**.
</Info>

### Access using Jupyter

While creating the instance, if you don't want to access the VM via SSH, you can use your Jupyter Authentication Token and paste it during the launching of Instance.

<Steps>
<Step title="Start Jupyter manually">
  Run
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
```
or
```bash
jupyter lab
```

Expected Output  
```bash
http://localhost:8888/?token=6c7b6d0c9f4f0f72d5ab8a38f6bff3e...
```
<Note>
  The long string after ```?token=``` is your auth token.
</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="If Jupyter is already running">
  Run
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook list

```
Expected Output  
```bash
Currently running servers:  
http://localhost:8888/?token=6c7b6d0c9f4f0f72d5ab8a38f6bff3e :: /home/user
```
<Note>
  The long string after ```?token=``` is your auth token.
</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="From Jupyter config (if token disabled or password set)">
  To find where configs are:
  ```bash
jupyter --config-dir
```
Then open ```jupyter_notebook_config.py``` and look for:
```bash
c.NotebookApp.token
c.NotebookApp.password
```
</Step>
<Step title="Docker / remote Jupyter">
  If Jupyter is running inside Docker, check the container logs:
  ```bash
docker logs <container_id>
```
<Note>
  Youâ€™ll see the token in the startup logs.
</Note>
</Step>
</Steps>
